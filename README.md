A generator to start quickly using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) with TypeScript
source code. This generator provides the following:

- **DevOps**
  - `build`, `deploy`, `watch` and many other useful devop scripts
  - All devop scipts written in TS; doesn't depend on any 3rd party build tools like Gulp, Grunt, etc.
- **Testing**:
  - Mocha test runner with chai assertion library
  - Configuration setup for using [Wallaby](http://wallabyjs.com) real-time testing in your editor
- **Serverless Enhancements**
  - Larger projects based on the Serverless framework tend to lead to a quite cluttered `serverless.yml` file; with this generator the build process will allow you to decompose the configuration in a sensible way.
  - The `serverless-step-functions` addon provides easy access AWS's Step functions
  - Typings provided for all serverless configuration allows your configuration to be checked within your editor before you try and deploy it as well as providing a better way of exploring the API surface allowed in configuration (with intellisence autocomplete and comments)
